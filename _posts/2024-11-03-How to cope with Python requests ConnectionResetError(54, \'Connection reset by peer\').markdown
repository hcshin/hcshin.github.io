# Situation
I was trying to run a Python project using requests for REST API interfacing. However whenever I try to run the script I got: 

```
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(54, 'Connection reset by peer'))
```

I rechecked the API guide webpage to see if there's a change with the URL. I also checked my token for the expiration. None of them has any problems.

# Solution
I searched it within Perplextity and among the answers there was the root cause of my problem. There was a CA certificate change for the API server's side. The solution was to upgrade `certifi` pip package.

```
$ python3 -m pip install -U certifi
```

After this the `ConnectionResetError(54)` was gone
